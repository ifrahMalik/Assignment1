# About:
The "PitchInFun" project uses Ruby to facilitate student involvement in volunteer events matching their interests. Utilizing CSV data inputs, the system matches students based on their listed interests with available events from an events database. Invalid interests or those not meeting specific criteria are flagged for review. The system optimizes event-student matching by prioritizing events with the least filled capacity and aligning student interests with event themes. The output includes detailed event information, including assigned student rosters and status (e.g., "Ok" or "Cancel"), alongside a statistical summary of valid students, events that can run, potential cancellations, and events with no student assignments. Additionally, unmatched students are accounted for, providing a comprehensive overview of the matching process.
